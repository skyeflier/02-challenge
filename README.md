# 02 Challenge

## Description

Bootcamp week two challenge tested my ability to create code from scratch for the first time and utilize the skills I've learned so far. There were so many challenges with this one from making a wireframe and trying to get the website to match my vision to adding elements to the code and having it disrupt other areas of code and having to refractor my own mistakes. It's certainly not as pretty as a website I could create on Shopify or Square, but it's really given me an appreciation for beautiful websites with clear UX. I'll continue to build on this, and with time, I'm sure it will be worlds apart from this initial version. 

## Usage
